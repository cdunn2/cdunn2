# Welcome to Connor Dunn's GitHub Profile üëã

## About Me
Hello there! I'm Connor Dunn, a passionate and motivated professional with an interest in Cybersecurity and Data Analysis. I recently completed my B.S. at James Madison University, I am enthusiastic about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation, and I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in internships.

## Projects
Explore my projects below to get a glimpse of my skills and interests:

### üåç AI-Driven Hyper-Local Risk Intel (WIP)

This project explores building an **AI-powered security briefing system** designed for professionals working or traveling in high-risk environments.  
Instead of generic travel advisories, the goal is to provide **hyper-local, actionable, and predictive intelligence**.

#### üîé Concept
- **Target users:** Contractors, NGOs, journalists, and expats operating in high-risk regions  
- **Focus areas:** Physical security, scams/fraud alerts, cyber threats, infrastructure disruptions, disinformation trends  
- **Delivery methods:** AI-generated summaries, chatbot integration (e.g., WhatsApp/Signal), and short audio briefings  
- **Differentiator:** Moves beyond country-level warnings to **city/district-specific insights and short-term risk forecasts**  

#### ‚ö° Current Status
This project is in **early exploration**. I am currently experimenting with:
- Pulling data from **RSS feeds and open-source reporting**  
- Using **AI summarization and classification** for risk categories  
- Prototyping **automated delivery workflows** (Zapier + manual AI tests)  

#### üöÄ Vision
The end goal is to create a tool that can deliver:
- **Neighborhood-level risk alerts**  
- **Predictive risk trends** (e.g., forecast of protests or cyber scams)  
- **Field-usable formats** for professionals abroad (chatbots, audio briefs, etc.)  

#### *Note: This is a work in progress. I‚Äôll be updating this repo as prototypes and demos are developed.*
